PyPDF2 doesnâ€™t allow directly editing a PDF. Instead, you have to create a new PDF 
and then copy content over from an existing document. The steps to do this are:
1. Open one or more existing PDFs (the source PDFs) into PdfFileReader
objects.
2. Create a new PdfFileWriter object.
3. Copy pages from the PdfFileReader objects into the PdfFileWriter object.
4. Finally, use the PdfFileWriter object to write the output PDF.
